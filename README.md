# hangman_game

***Description:***

What is the game about ?

The Hangman game is a simple game where one or more players try to guess a word, each turn suggesting 
a letter. In this implementation, we will not have the drawing of the man being hanged. We will just 
have the word with the letters appearing as more and more letters are guessed correctly.


***Installation:***

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone git@github.com:AlisherJard/LGG-Thomas4.git
cd LGG-Thomas4
cd projects
cd hangman


***Usage:***
To start the game, run the following command:
python main.py --file path/to/file.xlsx


***Game Instructions***

	1.	Create an object of the Hangman class.
	2.	Utilize the start_game() method to begin the game.
	3.	The game will prompt the player to guess letters to reveal the hidden word.
	4.	Players have a limited number of lives, which decrease with incorrect guesses.


***Timeline:***

	•	Day 1: Project setup and class development, integration.
	•	Day 2: Testing, debugging, and final touches.

***Personal Situation:***

This project was developed as a solo effort to enhance my Python and project management skills.

**Learning objectives:**

1) Learn project architecture

2) Apply basic programming principles (loop, conditions, functions)

3) Reinforce Python syntax
